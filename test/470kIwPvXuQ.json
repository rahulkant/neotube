                "description": "Presenting a compilation of Nazrul Geeti or Songs of Nazrul that showcases some of the rare Bengali Songs written by Nazrul in the form of Shyama Sangeet and other Hindu devotional song format. Kazi Nazrul Islam the name requires no introduction. The national poet of Bangladesh earned the title of \u201cRebel Poet\u201d for his fiery revolutionary writings. He was also a Bengali polymath, poet, writer, musician and revolutionary. Popularly known as Nazrul, his poetry and music espoused Indo-Islamic renaissance and intense spiritual rebellion against fascism and oppression. Nazrul's writings explore themes such as love, freedom, and revolution; he opposed all bigotry, including religion and gender. Throughout his career, Nazrul wrote short stories, novels, and essays but is best known for his poems, in which he pioneered new forms such as Bengali ghazals. Nazrul wrote and composed music for his nearly 4,000 songs (including gramophone records), collectively known as Nazrul geeti (Songs of Nazrul), which are widely popular today. In what his contemporaries regarded as one of his greatest flairs of creativity, Nazrul began composing the very first ghazals in Bengali, transforming a form of poetry written mainly in Persian and Urdu. Nazrul became the first person to introduce Islam into the larger mainstream tradition of Bengali music. The first record of Islamic songs by Nazrul Islam was a commercial success and many gramophone companies showed interest in producing these. A significant impact of Nazrul was that it drew made Muslims more comfortable in the Bengali Arts, which used to be dominated by Hindus. Nazrul also composed a number of notable Shamasangeet, Bhajan and Kirtan, combining Hindu devotional music. Arousing controversy and passions in his readers, Nazrul's ideas attained great popularity across India. In 1928, Nazrul began working as a lyricist, composer and music director for His Master's Voice Gramophone Company. The songs written and music composed by him were broadcast on radio stations across the country. He was also enlisted/attached with the Indian Broadcasting Company.\n\nAll songs compiled here are sung by the legendary Nazrul Geeti artist Shri Dhirendra Chandra Mitra. The soulful voice and melodious renditions of popular Nazrul Geeti like Shashaney Jagichhey Shyama and Brojo Gopi Khele Hori are a real treat that this compilation offers to a listener.\n\n== Album Song Data ==\nAll songs sung by Dhirendra Chandra Mitra\nAll Lyrics & Compositions: Kazi Nazrul Islam\n\n\u25ba Puhler Jalshay Nirab Keno 0:00:05\n\u25ba Shashaney Jagichhey Shyama 0:03:17\n\u25ba Bhorer Jhiler Jaley 0:06:44\n\u25ba Chaitali Chandini 0:09:47\n\u25ba Kajri Gahiya Esho 0:13:03\n\u25ba Ajo Kandey Kananey 0:16:45 \n\u25ba Brojo Gopi Khele Hori 0:19:31\n\u25ba Sandhya Malati Jobey 0:22:36\n\u25ba Nishiraatey Rim Jhim 0:25:37\n\u25ba Mahakaler Koley Eshey 0:28:28\n\u25ba Pratham Pradip Jala 0:31:44\n\u25ba Tumi Aamar Sakaal Belar 0:35:13\n\u25ba Shunya E Bukey 0:38:37\n\u25ba Biday Sandhya Aashilo 0:42:07",
