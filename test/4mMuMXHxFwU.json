Along with Mohammed Rafi, Kishore Kumar, Mukesh he was a part of Indian film playback music industry. He is rated as the best classical singer among all singers of Hindi film music, though he sang various types of songs from pop to folk. He has recorded more than 3500 songs over the course of his career. The Government of India honored him with the Padma Shri in 1971, the Padma Bhushan in 2005 and the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 2007.\nPadmabhusan Manna Dey is a legendary figure in Indian music. His fame is not restricted to the Indian domain only but has over flown to every part of the globe, where an Indian heart resides. In fact his is not merely a name that is deified everywhere, rather it creates a ripple of mixed feeling of love and worship whenever cited. People venerate him not only for his musical bearing but because he epitomizes a wonderful combination of melody and poetry. His stance in Indian music vindicates the axiom -- the art outlives the artist.\n\nSongs::\n\nSong : Jodi Kagoje Lekho Naam\nSinger : Manna Dey\nMusic Director : Nachiketa Ghosh\nLyricst : Gauriprasanna Mazumder\n\nSong : Jakhan Keu Amake Pagal Bale\nSinger : Manna Dey\nMusic Director : Manna Dey\nLyricst : Pulak Banerjee\n\nSong : Se Amar Chhoto Bon (Maar Sneho Kake Bale Janina)\nSinger : Manna Dey\nMusic Director : Suparnakanti Ghosh\nLyricst : Pulak Banerjee\n\nSong : Coffee Houser  Sei Addata Aaj Aar Nei\nSinger : Manna Dey\nMusic Director : Suparnakanti Ghosh\nLyricst : Gauriprasanna Mazumder\n\nSong : Hay Hay Go ,Raat Jay Go\nSinger : Manna Dey\nMusic Director : Manna Dey\nLyricst : Gauriprasanna Mazumder\n\nSong : Ogo Tomar Shesh Bicharer\nSinger : Manna Dey\nMusic Director : Sudhin Dasgupta\nLyricst : Tarashankar Banerjee\n\nSong : Ami Niralay Bose\nSinger : Manna Dey\nMusic Director : Manna Dey\nLyricst : Shyamal Gupta\n\nSong : Jani Tomar Premer Jogya Amito Noi\nSinger : Manna Dey\nMusic Director : Manna Dey\nLyricst : Pulak Banerjee\n\nSong : Sei To Abar Kachhe Ele\nSinger : Manna Dey\nMusic Director : Manna Dey\nLyricst : Pulak Banerjee\n\nSong : Aami Agantuk\nSinger : Manna Dey\nMusic Director : Sudhin Dasgupta\nLyricst : Pulak Banerjee\n\n\nSubscribe to us on: http://www.youtube.com/saregamabengali\n\nLike us on: https://www.facebook.com/saregama\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/saregamaglobal\n\nFor Mobile download Visit :: mobile.saregama.com",
