                "description": "Nazrul Geeti is a genre of Bengali Songs that originates from the works of the great rebel poet Kazi Nazrul Islam. Nazrul Geeti that literally translates to be songs of Nazrul is an integral part of Bengali culture. This compilation of Nazrul Geeti has some of the greatest Nazrul Geeti artists like Feroza Begum and Manabendra Mukherjee. Firoza Begum happened to be a direct disciple of Kazi Nazrul Islam. Feroza Begum is renowned for her Gazal Gayaki and Nazrul is the first Bengali composer who introduced Gazal in Bengali Songs. Manabendra Mukherji on the other hand is one of the greatest Bengali playback singers. But his fondness for Nazrul Geeti made him record several Nazrul Geeti records and thus made Manabendra Mukherji a house hold name when it came to Nazrul Geeti artists.\n\nKazi nazrul Islam who is fondly remembered as \u201cNazrul\u201d or the \u201cBidrohi Kobi\u201d (literally means the rebellious poet) was born in the village of Churulia in the Burdwan district which is in West Bengal now.  Kazi Nazrul Islam created an avant-garde genre of modern Bengali Songs. He wrote and composed these songs himself. This entire genre was termed later on as Nazrul Geeti or songs of Kazi Nazrul Islam. Nazrul wrote and composed music for his nearly 4,000 songs.\n\nKazi Nazrul Islam was highly motivated by the nationalist freedom movements and preached revolution through his poetic works, such as Bidrohi (The Rebel) and Bhangar Gaan (The Song of Destruction), as well as his publication Dhumketu (The Comet). He was hailed captive by the British Raaj many a times. Kazi Nazrul Islam fiercely inspired Bengalis during the Bangladesh Liberation War. Nazrul is held as the national poet of Bangladesh. \nThis assorted compilation of Nazrul Geeti has some of the most popular Nazrul songs sung by some of the greatest artists, many of whom were direct disciples of Kazi Nazrul Islam. Nazrul became the first person to introduce Islam into the larger mainstream tradition of Bengali music. Nazrul also composed some notable Shyama Sangeet, Kirtan and Bhajan which were essentially Hindu art forms. He was deeply influenced by the Arabic and Persian melodies. Which reflects mainly through his compositions. This compilation has songs sung by Feroza Begum, Suprava Sarkar and Sachin Dev Burman who were all direct disciples of Kazi Nazrul Islam. Songs like Koohu Koohu Koyelia and Rum Jhuma Rum Jhuma are a classic example of Kazi Nazrul Islam's profound compositional knowledge. With some of the biggest names in Nazrul Geeti this compilation \u201cAssorted Songs Of Kazi Nazrul Islam\u201d is a must have.\n\n== Songs in this Album ==\n\nAll Lyric & Composition: Kazi Nazrul Islam\n\n\u25ba Kaberi Nadi Jaley - Suprava Sarkar  0:00:01 \n\u25ba Koohu Koohu Koyelia - Sachin Dev Burman 0:03:33\n\u25ba Piu Piu Bale Papiya - Purabi Dutta 0:07:01\n\u25ba Chaitali Chandini - Dhirendra Chandra Mitra 0:09:51\n\u25ba Patha Cholite Jodi - Feroza Begum 0:13:03\n\u25ba Mahua Phooler Madir - Manabendra Mukherjee 0:16:49\n\u25ba Rum Jhuma Rum Jhuma - Suprava Sarkar 0:19:50\n\u25ba Bakul Chanpar Boney - Dhiren Bose 0:23:14\n\u25ba Kemone Kahi Priyo - Purabi Dutta 0:26:39\n\u25ba Meghla Nishi Bhorey - Sachin Dev Burman 0:29:43\n\u25ba Nirajaney Sakhi Bolo - Suprava Sarkar 0:32:54\n\u25ba Brojo Gopi Khele Hori - Dhirendra Chandra Mitra 0:37:53\n\u25ba Ashey Basanto Phulo Baney - Feroza Begum 0:40:55\n\u25ba Ebar Jakhan Uthbe - Manabendra Mukherjee 0:44:03\n\u25ba Naachey  Irani Meye - Feroza Begum 0:48:09\n\u25ba E Kon Madhur Gulbagichaay - Dhiren Bose 0:51:21\n\u25ba Bhuli Kemone - Suprava Sarkar 0:54:20 \n\u25ba Chokh Gelo Chokh Gelo - Sachin Dev Burman 0:57:49\n\u25ba Bhul Kori Jodi - Purabi Dutta 1:00:50\n\u25ba Shunya E Bukey - Dhirendra Chandra Mitra 1:03:41 \n\u25ba Kemoney Rakhi - Suprava Sarkar 1:07:09\n\u25ba Biday Sandhya  Asilo - Dhiren Bose 1:10:20",
